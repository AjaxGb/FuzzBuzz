A hamster-shaped alien crash-lands on Earth. Using his mental mastery over technology,
he must take control of the Earthlings' appliances to get his ship back and return home.

### CONTROLS + TIPS:
- Left click to take control of technology. This will leave your body comatose and defenseless!
- Left click again to return to your body.
- WASD + Space to move around.
- Area 51's "Zoombas" are capable of flight if properly handled.
- Do not be seen. Do not die.
- Reach the vent to continue into the next room.
